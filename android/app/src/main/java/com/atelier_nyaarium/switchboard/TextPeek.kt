/**
 * Decides whether a file is text the viewer can show, and returns it if so.
 *
 * The decoder does the classifying rather than a hand-rolled byte scan. It already separates the two
 * cases that matter: a multi-byte sequence cut off by the peek window returns UNDERFLOW, while bytes
 * that could not appear in the encoding at all return MALFORMED. A rule that forgave any bad tail
 * would excuse binary files whose last bytes happen to look truncated.
 *
 * Kotlin's `String(bytes)` cannot be used here. It substitutes U+FFFD for anything invalid and never
 * fails, so every file would classify as text and the distinction would be untestable.
