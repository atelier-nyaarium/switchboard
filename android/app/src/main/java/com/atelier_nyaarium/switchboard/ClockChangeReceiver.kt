/** Re-syncs the scheduled-send alarm against a live system clock or timezone change - a manual
 * clock adjustment, or an NTP correction after a device boots with a stale RTC value. RTC_WAKEUP
 * alarms are wall-clock based (unlike ELAPSED_REALTIME, immune to this) and Android gives no other
 * signal that one might now be mistimed. This is a defensive re-sync, not a fix for the deeper (and
 * genuinely ambiguous) product question of whether a relative scheduling intent - "10 minutes from
 * when I tapped Schedule" - should be preserved across a clock jump at all; it re-derives the next
 * alarm from whatever fireAtMillis is already persisted, the same way ChatRepository.
 * fireDueScheduledSends's own end-of-pass re-arm already does on every fire and every schedule/
 * cancel/reschedule. ACTION_TIME_CHANGED and ACTION_TIMEZONE_CHANGED are both on Android's small
 * manifest-registration exemption
 * list from the Oreo+ implicit-broadcast restrictions, so a static receiver (not a dynamically
 * registered one) is the correct, always-on shape here - verified by simulating both broadcasts on
 * a real emulator and confirming this receiver actually fires. */
