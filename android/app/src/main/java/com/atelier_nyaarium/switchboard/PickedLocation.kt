 * never a folder chain, so it cannot carry a username or a layout even by accident. A provider using
 * opaque ids yields nothing and the caller omits the row rather than guessing.
 *
 * Draft-only by construction. Nothing here is ever attached to a file type, so there is no
 * conversion that could carry it onto the wire.
