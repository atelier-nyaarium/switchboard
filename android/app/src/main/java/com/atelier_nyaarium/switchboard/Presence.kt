 * Nothing on the wire says which channel delivered a row, so a consumer that reads a value alone
 * silently assumes push latency and is wrong for every machine but one. That is the whole reason
 * this type exists, and why the status STRING below is private: the bug was never a wrong value, it
 * was `status == "available"` written at fourteen sites by code with no way to ask how old that was.

 * relaunch would otherwise let the first one's outcome clear the second one's. It carries an
 * outcome rather than only a time, because "we asked" and "it was accepted" and "it failed" are
 * three different things and a timer can express none of them. And it never outranks a Gateway
 * that has actually spoken (see [Presence.mayHavePane]): an optimistic value that can override real
 * evidence is a UI that lies, which is strictly worse than one that is late.

	 *   from becoming hundreds of remote peeks at the terminal's own cadence.
	 * - An asleep session with an outstanding receipt IS worth peeking: we asked for it ourselves.
	 * - Otherwise an "available" row means asleep and idling is right - which is what keeps a warm
	 *   container from being docker-exec'd every cycle for a session that is genuinely down.
	 *
	 * NO row is trusted enough to skip peeking entirely, LIVE included: a row says whether an AGENT
	 * registered and never whether the tmux PANE exists, and those differ for the whole time Claude is
	 * closed with a shell still sitting in the pane. The caller probes once per mount (see
	 * TerminalView), which settles the question for the price of a single op.
