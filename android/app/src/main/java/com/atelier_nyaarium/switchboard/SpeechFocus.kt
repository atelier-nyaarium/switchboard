//  Class

/**
 * The right to speak out loud, and the duty to stop.
 *
 * Held for a RUN rather than per playback: a burst is one continuous act of speaking, and requesting
 * per file would drop and retake focus in every marker gap, which other apps see as a stutter of
 * ducking.
 *
 * TRANSIENT gain, because a run speaks and ends - permanent gain stops the user's music for good
 * rather than letting it come back when the queue drains.
 *
 * What each loss means is [focusAction]'s call.
 *
 * Unplugging headphones is not a focus change at all, so it needs its own receiver. Without it, audio
 * routed to a headset re-routes to the phone's speaker and keeps reading agent messages aloud into
 * whatever room the user is standing in.
