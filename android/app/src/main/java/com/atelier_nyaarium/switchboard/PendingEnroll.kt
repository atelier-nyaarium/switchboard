/**
 * A Gateway this owner admitted whose bundle was never confirmed delivered.
 *
 * The admission goes out before any delivery is attempted, and it HAS to: the sealed bundle carries
 * that same admission inside it, so rolling it back on a failed delivery would break the paste
 * fallback that is the whole recovery path. An interrupted enrollment therefore leaves a real member
 * in the keyring that never received a byte, and without this record the Gateways screen cannot tell
 * that apart from a machine that is simply switched off.
 *
 * Keeping the sealed bundle is what makes resuming free of a re-scan. It is sealed to that Gateway's
 * box key and readable by nothing else, and the same bytes already reach the clipboard on the paste
 * path, so holding them here costs no secrecy that was not already spent.
