 * to identity, because two identities for one thing is what makes an abandon return a list.

 * stop, or advance a queue on, and giving it one made a message being pre-generated read as playing.
 * A purge reaches it through the epoch below instead, which covers it even between two of its writes,
 * where a claim could not.
 *
 * Which request is sounding lives here too. Split across two objects it needed two monitors, so a
 * bulk drop could release a newer generation's player while leaving its claim orphaned.
 *
 * Delivery lives here for the same reason. An event minted under this monitor but enqueued after it
 * was released could be overtaken by one minted later, so a `Started` could arrive behind its own
 * terminal. Appending inside the monitor makes delivery order the transition order by construction,
 * which is not something a consumer can be asked to reconstruct.
 *
 * `sink` is where delivery runs. The default runs inline, which is what a unit test wants; production
 * passes a single-thread lane so a listener cannot run under the monitor.
