/**
 * The Designer plugin's OWN per-team device store. This is NOT a framework-provided abstraction - the
 * framework owns `PluginRegistry`, not storage - so a future plugin needing its own store would lift
 * the generic seam out of this one, not reuse it as-is. It lives in the Designer's own
 * SharedPreferences file so it is never entangled with AppStateStore's provisioning/schema partitions.
 *
 * A process-global singleton (init once at plugin setup with the app context, then accessed
 * context-free): the poll-thread ingest handler and the UI dock share ONE per-team `StateFlow`, so
 * there is no split-brain between a service-side write and an activity-side read. The index is
 * ADDITIVE: an arriving dsCard `upsert`s by `fileName` (at-monotonic, so a redelivered older
 * revision cannot overwrite a newer one); `delete` shrinks the list.
 *
 * There is NO per-message watermark and NO removal guard: the inbound pipeline delivers each
 * message exactly once, strictly before the row can render, so no delete can precede the one write
 * a message ever causes. A deleted card's message is never re-read to re-add it.
