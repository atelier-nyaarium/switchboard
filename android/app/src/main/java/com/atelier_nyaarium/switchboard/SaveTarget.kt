/**
 * Where a saved attachment goes.
 *
 * There are two writers, not one, and neither can serve both cases. Downloads is reachable with no
 * permission at all through MediaStore, which is what makes a FIRST save possible: until the user
 * has picked a folder there is no persisted grant, so there is no tree Uri to write to. Once they
 * have picked one, that grant is the only way to reach a folder outside Downloads.
 *
 * A remembered grant is not durable. Clearing app data, deleting the folder, unmounting the volume,
 * or revoking the permission all leave the stored Uri looking fine while the write throws. Every
 * read therefore re-validates, so a dead grant degrades to the picker rather than to a bare "Save
 * failed" that gives the user nothing to act on.
 *
 * Takes the stored string rather than a store, so nothing here depends on where it is kept.
