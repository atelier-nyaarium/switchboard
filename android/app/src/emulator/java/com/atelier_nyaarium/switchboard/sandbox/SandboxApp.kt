/**
 * The `emulator` build type's entry point.
 *
 * EVERYTHING IN THIS SOURCE SET IS SCAFFOLDING, NOT A SPEC. Add a thread shape, delete a fixture,
 * or bend the canned state to whatever is being looked at this week. None of it is load-bearing and
 * none of it needs to stay consistent with anything. If a fixture stops being useful, remove it
 * rather than maintaining it.
 *
 * What this build is for: looking at the console without a Gateway, an owner key, an admission, or a
 * network. The real app cannot get past onboarding without all four, which meant every visual
 * question had to be answered by the owner on their phone. A CSS variable that was never defined
 * made every reference link in every message render as plain prose, and no test on either side of
 * the wire could see it. That is the class of bug this exists to catch.
 *
 * Nothing here is compiled into debug or release: this source set only belongs to the `emulator`
 * build type. The shared code it needs lives in `SandboxSeeder.kt` and is compiled into every
 * variant, so each piece of it stands behind `isSandbox`.
