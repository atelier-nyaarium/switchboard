/**
 * The canned board and threads the sandbox opens into.

 * SCAFFOLDING. Add, change, or delete any of this freely. It is chosen to cover the surfaces that
 * could not be inspected without a screen, nothing more:
 *
 *  - a reference message with REAL artifacts, so claimed-link styling and the code viewer both work
 *  - an `exact` ref beside a `fuzzy` one, which render as two different colours
 *  - an image attachment, whose thumbnail is indistinguishable from a missing chip when its bytes
 *    are gone
 *  - a plain file chip, the non-image path
 *  - enough rows to scroll, for the read pointer and the unread divider
 *
 * The ref artifacts under `assets/sandbox/` are REAL builder output, not hand-written JSON, so the
 * viewer is exercised against the same bytes an agent would send. Regenerate them by running the
 * reference builder over this repo and overwriting both files; they will drift from the builder
 * eventually, and that is fine for a sandbox.
