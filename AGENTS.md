# Agents

Cross-team communication and devcontainer coordination. This file is a map, not history.

## Layout

- `src/main-mcp.ts` / `main-gateway.ts` / `main-host-daemon.ts` / `main-federation.ts` / `main-vault-askpass.ts` - five entry points
- `src/vault-askpass/askpass.ts` - the askpass helper's decision over gateway, tty, and clock ports; the tty race and the no-tty hold
- `src/gateway/` - Docker-side HTTP and WS router
- `src/gateway/composeGateway.ts` - fifteen compose stages, fault port, and cycles; `index.ts` is the Bun adapter
- `src/gateway/compose/gatewayTypes.ts` - `GatewayConfig`, `GatewayDeps`, `GatewayGraph`, and the `GatewayFaultPort` the harness drives
- `src/gateway/compose/federationContext.ts` - the one federation reader; activation publishes boot, Domain id, and slice together, and it posts the Router share record
- `src/gateway/compose/composeBootstrap.ts` - directories, identity, keyring, boot decision, schema wipe
- `src/gateway/compose/composeStores.ts` - every durable writer and the restored session-resume payload
- `src/gateway/compose/composeSessions.ts` - registries, `SessionStore`, planes, presence, session authority
- `src/gateway/compose/composePersistence.ts` - the flush every writer takes part in, and its tick
- `src/gateway/compose/composeHost.ts` - the host socket, wake service, host relay, presence watch
- `src/gateway/compose/composeAgents.ts` - Codex and Copilot services, relays, and HTTP routes
- `src/gateway/compose/composeAwareness.ts` - the awareness bank and its tick
- `src/gateway/compose/composeFederation.ts` - `buildSlice`, the Router client, and the share sweep
- `src/gateway/compose/composeEnrollment.ts` - the enrollment window, its TLS door, and the install
- `src/gateway/compose/composeWebSockets.ts` - session sockets and held-delivery handover
- `src/gateway/compose/composeRoutes.ts` - the route surface, rebuilt when federation activates
- `src/gateway/compose/composeRouterFrames.ts` - Router frame dispatch and the console dispatcher
- `src/gateway/compose/composeRouterPresence.ts` - cross-Domain presence pipeline, unlink and untrust teardown
- `src/gateway/compose/composeListener.ts` - the HTTP entry point and the shutdown flush
- `src/gateway/compose/composeFaults.ts` - the fault port's construction
- `src/gateway/httpRouter.ts` - HTTP dispatch, the enrollment routes, and the blob routes
- `src/gateway/routes.ts` - `RoutesDeps`, `RoutesCarryOver`, and the composer that wires the route modules
- `src/gateway/routes/addressing.ts` / `callerGuards.ts` / `relay.ts` - local address minting, the refusal gates, cross-Gateway relay
- `src/gateway/routes/routesStatus.ts` / `routesCapabilities.ts` / `routesPresence.ts` - health, pending and teams; the capability fold; discovery
- `src/gateway/routes/routesSend.ts` / `routesRespond.ts` / `routesBoard.ts` - the send, the reply and its poll, the task board
- `src/gateway/routes/routesHumanNotify.ts` / `routesBlob.ts` / `routesFederationPresence.ts` - console push, blob fetch, and presence exchange bindings
- `src/gateway/boot.ts` - `GatewayBootstrap.resolve`, the boot phase decision, the federation slice types, and `RouterHandlers` split into frames and presence
- `src/gateway/router/registerAuth.ts` / `valueResult.ts` - the `gateway_register` frame and the `value_result` settlement, pure
- `src/gateway/wake.ts` - container/session wake decisions
- `src/gateway/wakeService.ts` - one launch per team, whichever door it came through
  - **A joiner gets the launch, not a second one:** `joinCreate` hands the first caller a release
    closure and every later one `null`, so a create cannot be wired to join without being able to
    end, and presence starts and ends once however many callers arrive. A launch that failed is not
    waited on for registration, which would otherwise hold the team for the whole wake timeout and
    refuse close and forget for that long.
- `src/gateway/sessionAuthority.ts` - sole owner of credential-field access; residue-tested
- `src/gateway/presence.ts` / `readAnchors.ts` / `hostOpCoordinator.ts` - presence, read anchors, host RPC correlation
- `src/gateway/router/boardClient.ts` - Router-held task board client
- `src/gateway/router/vaultClient.ts` - vault sealing/opening, delta-held Router list, approval-gated values, and the gateway write
- `src/gateway/vault/decisions.ts` / `requests.ts` / `helperTokens.ts` / `vaultRoutes.ts` - grants and `displayShape`; request rows that settle once, admit a joining caller, and cap open requests per target; helper tokens; loopback routes
- `src/gateway/vault/operationSet.ts` - the one shape rule, the wrapper table read from each program's help, and the set a window grant covers
- `src/gateway/compose/composeVault.ts` - vault client, decisions, requests, routes, and console operations
- `src/gateway/runbooks/store.ts` - gateway-held runbooks; sole writer, so a stored record has passed the rules
- `src/gateway/routines/store.ts` - gateway-held routines; sole writer, and it publishes `onChanged` so the runner cannot be left armed for what the store no longer says
- `src/gateway/routines/routineRoutes.ts` / `sessionRoutine.ts` - the loopback door a routine's own session reads its instructions through, and the four outcomes it answers with
  - **The gateway names every revision:** a put carries the revision the caller read and the store
    writes its own successor, answering with the record. Nothing on the phone chooses a number, so a
    number the gateway would not have chosen is unwritable. A base that does not match what is held
    is refused with what is; a repeat of the stored content at the stored base is a lost answer.
    `overwrite` replaces regardless, still at the next revision, because no revision arithmetic can
    tell a copy that descends from the held one from a divergent one. Only an owner tap reaches it.
- `src/gateway/compose/composeRunbooks.ts` - the runbook store and its console operations
- `src/gateway/routines/store.ts` / `occurrences.ts` / `runner.ts` - routines, their occurrences, and
  the loop that walks one; `compose/composeRoutines.ts` arms it from federation activation
  - **`advance` is the only door:** the timer, the reconcile tick and a manual Run now all enter
    there, so none of them can walk an occurrence another is already walking.
  - **`dispatched` is written before delivery is attempted:** a crash between them loses the run
    visibly rather than repeating it, which is the at-most-once choice. Enablement and the deadline
    are re-read immediately before that write, since preparation is awaited.
  - **Recovery cannot reach past `since`:** the gateway stamps when it took a routine, so one saved
    today is never handed a miss for a slot that passed before it existed.
- `src/gateway/console/consoleRunbookFire.ts` - renders a stored runbook and lands it in a session, creating one first
  - **A preview and a fire reach the same words:** `textOf` is the one road from an id and values to
    text, so `runbook_preview` cannot answer something a `runbook_fire` would not send. A fire may
    name the revision it previewed, and a stored record that has moved past it is refused.
  - **A durable in-flight record is a crash, not a fire in flight:** `consoleHandler` keeps its own
    set of fires this process started. A completion on disk replays, a held key refuses, and
    anything else runs. The key is released only once the completion is durable, or a success the
    migration fence refused to record could be delivered twice.
- `src/gateway/boardAwareness.ts` - board awareness recipients and net-change classification
- `src/gateway/awarenessBank.ts` - subscriber state, deadlines, and liveness reads
- `src/gateway/daemonCapabilities.ts` - daemon capability answer
- `src/gateway/federation/contentKeyStore.ts` - gateway keyring, sole rule owner, sole writer of `content-keys.json`
- `src/gateway/federation/bootstrapInstall.ts` - staged bootstrap install and re-enrollment merge
- `src/gateway/federation/crossDomainPresenceSource.ts` - source-side change detection and its outbound plane
- `src/gateway/federation/crossDomainPresencePusher.ts` - per-destination push coalescing and retry
- `src/gateway/federation/crossDomainPresenceConsumer.ts` - landed state from a linked friend's push
- `src/gateway/federation/crossDomainPresenceReconciler.ts` - backstop pull, decoupled from the console poll loop
- `src/gateway/codexAgentService.ts` / `codexRelay.ts` / `codexRoute.ts` - Codex catalog orchestration, relay folding, authenticated route
- `src/gateway/codexAgentReducers.ts` - Codex pure decision functions: acceptance verdicts, activity and terminal folds
- `src/gateway/codexAgentApply.ts` - Codex daemon event and receipt folding, with its fence checks
- `src/gateway/codexAgentPersistence.ts` - Codex catalog reads, replay, and commits
- `src/gateway/codexAgentTypes.ts` - Codex service deps, transition results, and the application union
- `src/gateway/copilotAgentService.ts` / `copilotRelay.ts` / `copilotRoute.ts` - Copilot catalog orchestration, relay folding, authenticated route
- `src/gateway/copilotAgentReducers.ts` - Copilot pure decision functions: target matching, activity append
- `src/gateway/copilotAgentApply.ts` - Copilot daemon event and receipt folding, with its fence checks
- `src/gateway/copilotAgentPersistence.ts` - Copilot catalog reads, replay, and commits
- `src/gateway/copilotAgentTypes.ts` - Copilot service deps, transition results, and the application union
- `src/gateway/router/` - Router WS client; `pinnedSocket.ts` owns certificate pinning
- `src/gateway/router/inboxDeliveryPump.ts` / `inboxClaims.ts` / `sessionRegistryReporter.ts` - inbox drain with durable claims, and session registry reporting that keeps a refused write pending and retries it
- `src/gateway/router/presenceReporter.ts` / `presenceProtocol.ts` - presence pump and pure protocol; `applyAnswer` cannot reach the sender, so answers do not start frames
- `src/gateway/router/shareAttestor.ts` - share liveness attestation, coalesced
- `src/gateway/router/boardClient.ts` - sole sealer of board text and sole local-key mapper; CAS writes
- `src/gateway/router/blobUploader.ts` - blob copy to the Router cache or reference-held store; unwired, and the Router refuses both upload frames
- `src/gateway/console/` - Android OwnerOp dispatch and capability store
- `src/gateway/console/consoleCrossDomain.ts` - the console's link, share, unlink and untrust handlers
- `src/gateway/console/consoleSessionLifecycle.ts` - create, wake, close, forget, and rename
- `src/gateway/console/consoleTerminal.ts` - pane peek, key send, directory listing, and plugin reload
- `src/gateway/consolePushOps.ts` - phone-bound rows, `deliverToOwner`, and durable `OwnerRowOutbox`
- S8 retained endpoints: `/capabilities`, `/discover`, `/task-board`
- `android/.../ChatRepository.kt` - console process singleton, OwnerOp client, and home Gateway state
- `android/.../PhoneIdentity.kt` / `PhoneBootstrap.kt` / `PhoneAmbient.kt` - the one door for identity facts, the boot value it publishes, and the ambient record (clock, entropy, ids, timer)
- `android/.../SandboxSeeder.kt` - the emulator build's seam: `isSandbox`, the identity facts a
  sandbox boot needs, and the canned state it publishes
- `android/.../RepositoryPorts.kt` / `RepositoryCollaborators.kt` - role ports for the ops classes and their repository adapters
- `android/.../Message.kt` / `MessageFile.kt` / `MessageText.kt` / `Draft.kt` / `ThreadOps.kt` / `ReadAnchor.kt` / `ChatState.kt` / `ConnError.kt` / `FederationTypes.kt` / `ScheduledSend.kt` - repository value types and pure helpers
- `android/.../ChatPersistence.kt` - JSON codec between repository state and AppStateStore
- `android/.../PollDrain.kt` - owner-inbox tick, four plane cursors, and drain-gate subscribers
- `android/.../DrainGate.kt` / `DrainHost.kt` / `SessionHost.kt` / `PresenceHost.kt` - the re-entrant drain gate and one host interface per ops class, each with its repository adapter beside it
- `android/.../ReportReadCompose.kt` / `ScheduledSendCompose.kt` / `CapabilitiesCompose.kt` - pure phone composers
- `android/.../PlaybackOps.kt` / `PlaybackReadModels.kt` - playback serialization and lock-free read models
- `android/.../BoardOps.kt` - repository board operations
- `android/.../VaultOps.kt` - repository vault operations: refresh, save, delete, reveal, answer, grants
- `android/.../RunbookOps.kt` - the gateway calls, `pushDecision`, and the refusal a save answers with
  - **A save is pushed before it answers:** stored takes it into the library and closes the editor,
    refused leaves the library alone and keeps the editor open, and no Gateway reached means the
    copy is local. `keep` decides the last part by whether the library actually took the candidate,
    so a save the merge would drop is refused rather than silent.
  - **One word for a turned-down save, and one producer per side:** `SaveRefusal` is the value,
    `gatewayRefusal` reads one out of a gateway answer, `libraryRefusal` builds one when the phone's
    own library declines, `refusalsAfterPut` folds them, and `refusalFor` reads the standing one.
  - **`standingRefusal` withdraws a spent offer:** below the draft's revision, rebasing onto the
    held one would mint a revision `merge` discards. It filters only the leftover refusal; one the
    current save earned outranks it, which `RunbookEditor` names rather than nests.
  - **The phone adopts the revision, it does not mint one:** `save` sends the revision the editor was
    opened at and keeps whatever record the gateway answers with. The library holds one copy per
    runbook, so its revision is the home gateway's and another gateway drifts from it.
  - **An edit in progress lives in `RunbookOps`, not the screen:** the repository outlives an
    activity and saved instance state is a parcel, which a runbook body is not bounded to fit.
- `android/.../runbooks/RunbookManager.kt` - the phone-held library and its persistence, beside `BoardManager`
  - **On disk before it is shown:** a refused write leaves the owner the library they still have.
    `clearInMemory` is the exception, since a re-provision takes the previous owner's writing out of
    memory whether or not the disk cooperates.
  - **One copy per gateway, because a revision describes one gateway's record:** a single library
    carried one gateway's numbers into another, so two gateways at the same revision with different
    content lost a branch by arrival order. Every read and write names the gateway.
- `android/.../runbooks/RunbookDraft.kt` / `RunbookGrammar.kt` / `RunbookEditor.kt` - the editor's model, its recognition twin, and the screen
  - **The parameter list is derived, and settings are keyed by placeholder name:** a deleted
    placeholder keeps its settings while editing and `toRunbook` prunes them. `RunbookGrammar` is
    the Kotlin twin of `placeholdersOf`, pinned by `tests/fixtures/runbook-grammar/vectors.json`,
    and recognises names without rendering.
- `android/.../runbooks/RunbooksScreen.kt` / `RunbookFireSheet.kt` - the tab with Fire per row, and the fire sheet
  - **The preview is the gateway's render, never the phone's:** the sheet calls `runbook_preview`, so
    one implementation of the grammar serves both it and the fire. An edit marks the shown text
    stale rather than blanking it, and Fire waits for a preview whose revision matches the runbook.
  - **`FireSheetState` holds two lifetimes:** the values and the preview belong to a runbook at a
    revision and `adopt` resets them; the target and a fire in flight belong to the sheet.
- `android/.../runbooks/RunbookText.kt` - the one-line form an option and a body are shown in, and
  the trim a typed option passes through
  - **A cut chip says it was cut:** `chipLabel` takes the first line to a character cap and marks
    what it dropped, since `maxLines` alone shows a short first line as if it were the whole value.
    The cut never ends on half a surrogate pair. The Kotlin gate reads this rule; no gate here reads
    a Compose layout.
  - **A typed option keeps its indent:** `trimmedOption` drops blank edge lines, and trims fully only
    when one line is left, so a pasted block does not lose the indentation of its first line alone.
- `android/.../AttachmentOps.kt` - attachment fetch-and-sweep state
- `android/.../ScheduledSendOps.kt` - scheduled sends and single fire mutex
- `android/.../GoalOps.kt` / `Goal.kt` - armed goals and `/goal` line production
- `android/.../PresenceOps.kt` - team presence and read-anchor reporting
- `android/.../SessionOps.kt` - terminal and session controls
- `android/.../ChatRepositorySend.kt` / `ChatRepositoryThreads.kt` / `ChatRepositoryDomainLink.kt` / `ChatRepositoryInbox.kt` / `ChatRepositoryMigration.kt` / `ChatRepositoryStts.kt` / `ChatRepositoryDrafts.kt` - stateless repository extensions
- `android/.../ConnectCoordinator.kt` - the connect sequence over the identity door and the Router reach; `ChatRepository.connect()` delegates to it
- `android/.../RouterReach.kt` / `ConsoleRouterTransport.kt` / `ConsoleSocketMode` - Router addresses, the OwnerOp post with reach failover and pinning, socket mode
- `android/.../OwnerFacts.kt` / `GatewayEnrollment.kt` / `EnrollCeremonyOps.kt` / `DeviceApprovalOps.kt` / `DomainAdminOps.kt` / `TrustOps.kt` - federation delegates
- `android/.../SasExchange.kt` / `EnrollCeremony.kt` - shared SAS exchange and commitment core for FLOW-1 and FLOW-2
- `android/.../crypto/ContentKeyring.kt` - phone keyring, classify then commit
- `android/.../crypto/ContentAadKinds.kt` - sole AAD kind builders, twins of `content-envelope.ts`; `aad-kinds-residue.test.ts` pins both to one vector each
- `android/.../MainActivity.kt` - `Repo`, activity, and `App` navigation shell
- `android/.../SessionsScreen.kt` / `SettingsScreen.kt` / `ThreadScreen.kt` / `Onboarding.kt` / `SessionDialogs.kt` / `ReorderableTabRow.kt` / `TabDragMath.kt` / `TimeText.kt` - screen siblings and tab geometry
- `android/.../RendererPoolBindings.kt` / `AppOverlays.kt` / `LinkMenu.kt` - WebView pool, overlays, and link actions
- `android/.../SettingsSections.kt` / `SettingsSystem.kt` / `SettingsVoice.kt` - settings leaf screens
- `android/.../MainTabsScreen.kt` / `SessionsHeaders.kt` / `SessionCard.kt` / `SessionCardPreview.kt` / `SessionsEmptyState.kt` - sessions tab shell, cards, rules, and empty-state machine
- `android/.../vault/` - `VaultSealing.kt` / `VaultManager.kt` / `VaultRouterWriter.kt` / `VaultDraft.kt` / `ApprovalGate.kt` / `VaultScreen.kt` / `VaultEntryDialog.kt` / `VaultRequestSheet.kt` / `VaultRequestText.kt` / `VaultState.kt` - the sealing door, the held entry set with pending requests and the retry count, the owner-op writer, the draft-to-sealed rule, the one owner-presence gate, the tab, the editor, the request sheet, its pure text rules (title, requester, countdown, repeat line), and the held request shapes
- `android/.../crypto/ContentSealing.kt` - the one sealing door the board and the vault subclass; only the AAD builder differs
- `android/.../plugins/vault/VaultPlugin.kt` - claims `vault:request`, forget, and wipe
- `android/.../board/` - board reducers and durable `BoardManager`
- `android/.../board/BoardSealing.kt` / `BoardRender.kt` / `BoardIntent.kt` / `BoardOptimistic.kt` / `BoardRouterWriter.kt` - board text sealing, render with cached fallback, edits held as intent, optimistic apply, and the CAS drain
- `android/.../ConsoleTransportCoordinator.kt` / `ConsoleSocketDriver.kt` - one Router consumer across two transports, and generation-fenced frame routing
- `android/.../Federation.kt` / `FederationManager.kt` / `CrossDomainLink.kt` / `ConsoleClientCrossDomain.kt` / `CrossDomainPresenceUi.kt` - cross-Gateway routing, identity, allowlist, sealing, replay, and presence
- `src/mcp/` - Claude Code tools
- `src/mcp/bridge/` / `channel/` / `references/` / `board/` / `designer/` / `connector/` - bridge, channel, reference, board, designer, and connector tools
- `src/mcp/vault/vaultTools.ts` / `vaultRun.ts` - vault tools over the gateway's loopback routes, and the child run that injects a value and scrubs it from the output
- `src/mcp/routines/routineTools.ts` - `get_session_routine`, registered for any token-bound session and behind no capability
- `src/mcp/devcontainer/` - host daemon plumbing and per-session tools
- `src/mcp/devcontainer/hostResolve.ts` - pure host/workdir/watch-target resolution and tmux command construction
- `src/mcp/devcontainer/windowsSpawn.ts` - Windows PowerShell probing, WSL path translation, and native directory listing
- `src/mcp/devcontainer/buildTranscript.ts` - latest `devcontainer up` transcript and pane-less terminal fallback
- `src/mcp/devcontainer/codexTargets.ts` - one supervised Codex App Server per execution target
- `src/mcp/devcontainer/codexAppServer.ts` - JSONL transport and fail-closed App Server client
- `src/mcp/devcontainer/codexThreadLifecycle.ts` - per-thread queues, settled-turn archival, bounded retirement
- `src/mcp/devcontainer/codexTurnTracker.ts` - turn output; sole `answerOf` reader
- `src/mcp/devcontainer/codexLiveTurns.ts` - live-turn bindings, clocks, and warnings
- `src/mcp/devcontainer/agentDaemonCore.ts` - shared daemon registry, generation fence, serialization, numbering, and outbox
- `src/mcp/devcontainer/codexDaemonService.ts` / `copilotDaemonService.ts` - daemon relay services
- `src/mcp/devcontainer/codexCommandDispatch.ts` - one command kind per run: session acquire, turn start and steer
- `src/mcp/devcontainer/codexSessionLifecycle.ts` - session open, retire, and held-terminal deadlines
- `src/mcp/devcontainer/codexWatchdog.ts` - silent-turn interrupt and idle-target reap
- `src/mcp/local/` - daemonless agent backend
- `src/mcp/local/localAgentRuntime.ts` - the lease, the operation claim, and the dispatch to a request kind
- `src/mcp/local/localAgentHandlers.ts` - per-kind request handlers and turn bookkeeping
- `src/mcp/local/localChildSession.ts` - the one child: open, idle reap, shutdown
- `src/mcp/local/localOperationLedger.ts` - operation identity claim and release
- `src/mcp/agentDispatch.ts` - agent tool serving seam
- `src/mcp/codex/codexTools.ts` - five Codex tools and per-invocation replay ids
- `src/mcp/capabilities.ts` / `capabilitiesTool.ts` - capability gating and guidance
- `src/federation-server/` - live self-hosted federation Router
- `src/federation-server/routerServer.ts` - public `handle(Request)` over `preflight` and `dispatch`; sole `serve()` adapter and sole owner of the node HTTP types; residue-tested
- `src/federation-server/routerBody.ts` - body cap, the too-large, aborted and bodyless-method refusals, and the request both surfaces settle into
- `src/federation-server/ownerOpRegistry.ts` - the owner-op catalog: kind, value schema, mutation class, answer schema; sole kind list for the codegen and the fences
- `src/federation-server/routerDomainBootstrap.ts` - what the Router constructor builds, assembled once
- `src/federation-server/fileSecretStore.ts` - durable federation state and bounded atomic CAS
- `src/federation-server/owner/` - per-owner state layer: fsync'd journal, CAS records, per-address rows, quarantine, lock, Domain quota
- `src/federation-server/inbox/` - inbox service, op ledger, consumer and session registries, gateway incarnation, OwnerOp intake, blob fetch route
- `src/federation-server/inbox/inboxAppend.ts` / `inboxRetire.ts` / `inboxSweep.ts` / `inboxOpResult.ts` / `inboxCore.ts` - row append and admission, row retirement, the expiry sweep, router-authored result rows, and shared primitives (`recordId`, `guarded`, `ledgerTransaction`, `ownerAddress`, `floorOf`) behind `InboxService`
- `src/federation-server/blobs/` - Router blob cache with leases and the reference-held store
- `src/federation-server/ownerServices.ts` / `ownerServiceHooks.ts` - the owner-state services behind one hook surface: OwnerOp kinds, gateway frames, register and drop listeners, and the sweepers the fence holds
- `src/federation-server/presence/` - presence rows per gateway incarnation, resync, roster, owner and friend projections
- `src/federation-server/share/` - share records, generations, attestations, sweep, unlink; the peer-row gate
- `src/federation-server/board/` - board records with sealed text, authority and cascade on the clear envelope, observation rows
- `src/federation-server/vault/` - vault entries: sealed fields, revision CAS, phone writes, gateway creates, unopened fields
- `src/shared/schemasVault.ts` - vault wire truth: entries, puts, results, requests, grants, console answers
- `src/shared/schemasRunbook.ts` - runbook wire truth and `runbookRefusal`, the rules a stored record passes
  - **A body's placeholders ARE its parameter list:** `runbookRefusal` refuses either without the
    other, so no stored runbook carries a blank nothing can fill or a parameter nothing uses. It
    bounds nothing by size; a record is refused for what it means.
- `src/shared/schemasRoutine.ts` - routine wire truth and `routineRefusal`
  - **A schedule is refused by asking the calculator:** whether a rule can ever come around is not
    something reading its fields answers, so `routineRefusal` calls `nextOccurrence` from the start
    date rather than judging the weekday set and interval by eye.
- `src/shared/routine-recurrence.ts` - the next instant a rule names, read in the rule's own zone
  - **Both sides of a transition are considered, never just the probe's:** a wall time probed as if
    it were UTC lands on whichever side of an overlap that instant falls, which is the earlier one in
    Los Angeles and the later one in London. A gap answers the moment it ends, found by searching for
    where the offset changes.
  - **The walk is bounded by the rule's interval, and starts at the start date:** a fixed window
    would answer "never" for a routine beginning past it.
- `src/shared/runbook-grammar.ts` - the `{{name}}` grammar and the render, shared by the store and the fire
  - **One parse owns the grammar:** `parseBody` refuses a `{{` that opens no placeholder, so text
    shaped like one is a parse decision rather than a guard beside the scan. A lone `}}` stays
    literal, since prose about JSON closes nested braces.
  - **`renderRunbook` reads its own output:** a value and the literals around it can each be
    innocent and compose a placeholder only after substitution, which no check on the body can see.
  - **The whitespace class is written out longhand:** JavaScript `\s` matches U+00A0 and JVM `\s`
    does not, so `RunbookGrammar.kt` could not agree with a shorthand. `tests/fixtures/runbook-grammar/vectors.json` pins both.
  - **A Kotlin `Regex` must be written for ICU, not for the desktop JVM:** Android compiles patterns
    with ICU, which refuses a bare `}` that OpenJDK accepts as a literal. `testDebugUnitTest` runs on
    OpenJDK and cannot see the difference, and there is no `androidTest` source set, so a pattern
    that crashes on the phone can pass every gate. `icu-regex-residue.test.ts` now reads every phone
    `Regex` literal for it, since nothing that runs Kotlin can.
- `src/federation-server/scheduled/` - scheduled sends: versioned records, timers, fire through the op ledger, result rows
- `src/federation-server/tier1/` - capability fold and read anchors
- `src/federation-server/migration/` - leases, serve gate, and cursor translation
- `src/shared/board-authority.ts` / `board-cascade.ts` / `board-structure.ts` / `board-observations.ts` - pure board rules shared by the gateway and the Router
- `src/shared/share-rules.ts` / `presence-projection.ts` / `presence-identity.ts` / `read-anchor-rules.ts` / `capability-fold.ts` - pure state rules shared by the gateway and the Router
- `src/shared/versioned-list.ts` - the fold every Router-held list consumer applies (a full list replaces, a delta merges, a stale answer restarts or is ignored); `android/.../VersionedList.kt` is the twin, pinned by `tests/fixtures/versioned-list/vectors.json`
  - **A mailbox epoch is a random tag, never a counter:** `mintEpoch` draws it. Compare epochs for
    EQUALITY only. Sequence orders rows within an epoch. Across epochs, the later report wins. The
    receiver stamps `at`; it decides cross-epoch merges. `ReadAnchor.kt` is the phone twin and
    resolves by row position.
- `src/federation-server/gatewayBridge.ts` / `gatewayTransport.ts` - connection registry and frame dispatch; four trust callbacks required
- `src/federation-server/bridge/registrationHandler.ts` / `relayRouter.ts` / `inboxFrames.ts` / `frameDispatch.ts` - gateway registration; cross-gateway relay and cross-Domain handshake; incarnation-gated inbox, blob, and value frames; the gateway-frame catalog, one descriptor per frame the bridge dispatches, built-in or service, with its mutation class, its incarnation policy, and its handler; the migration fence holds every class but `read`, as the owner-op intake does
- `src/federation-server/consoleSurface.ts` / `publicApproval.ts` - token-gated operations and token-exempt nonce routes
- `src/federation-server/routerTls.ts` - persistent self-signed certificate; rotation re-provisions clients
- `src/federation-server/*Coordinator.ts` - in-memory flow windows; restart loses and re-arms them
- `src/shared/agent-binary.ts` - uncached backend CLI presence check
- `src/shared/capabilities.ts` - capability ids, guidance, daemon declarations, and bundle folding
- `src/shared/schemas.ts` / `schemas*.ts` - sole Zod wire truth; `.meta({id})` names generated Kotlin classes
- `src/shared/schemasWireFixture.ts` - shared wire fixture schema for both runtimes
- `src/shared/sealed-blob.ts` - per-chunk blob AEAD, twinned by `crypto/SealedBlob.kt` over a shared fixture corpus
- `src/shared/content-envelope.ts` - content key derivation, content envelope, key envelope, join signing bytes
  - **Board text binds its entry id into the AAD kind:** `boardTextAadKind` is the sole builder. A
    bare board kind does not typecheck. `BoardSealing.aad` is its Kotlin twin and must match byte for
    byte. The revision is absent. An untouched title or body keeps its envelope across edits. A device
    missing the epoch cannot re-seal it.
- `src/shared/schemasContentKey.ts` - content key wire shapes
- `src/shared/codex-agent.ts` / `codexAgent*.ts` - Codex delegation wire truth; excluded from Kotlin codegen
- `src/shared/copilot-agent.ts` / `copilotAgent*.ts` - Copilot delegation wire truth; excluded from Kotlin codegen
- `src/shared/channel-file.ts` - declared ChannelFile metadata; receivers do not infer it from bytes or position
- `src/shared/session-id.ts` - sole address grammar owner
- `src/shared/session-commands.ts` - what a session can be told to call: one entry per command, holding the tool name, the gateway path and both schemas
  - **A nudge names a command, never a tool:** the prose renders the catalogue's name, the gateway
    serves its path and the MCP registers it, so words cannot ask for something nothing answers.
    `check:boot` runs the real `main-mcp` and proves the tool is there.
- `src/shared/host-spawn.ts` - sole host-shell spawn-segment and command owner
- `src/shared/crypto.ts` / `admission.ts` / `router-protocol.ts` / `federation-lifecycle.ts` - federation trust wire vocabulary
- `src/shared/notice.ts` - shared notice tiers
- `src/shared/wire-vocabulary.ts` - sole TS declaration of Router paths, the console header, signing tags, the bridge's refusals, nonce lengths; generated into `Protocol.Wire` beside the owner-op kinds the registry catalogues; residue-fenced on both runtimes
- `src/shared/fixture-identity.ts` - the committed test signing keys; shipping entry points refuse them without `ALLOW_FIXTURE_IDENTITY=1`
- `src/shared/ambient.ts` - the clock, entropy, ids, and timers as one injected record; `processAmbient` is the sole reader of the globals and unrefs every timer it hands back. `composeGateway` and `RouterServerParams` take one and thread it everywhere; `ambient-residue.test.ts` fences the three directories and names the reason for each allowed file. Vocabulary shared with the phone's `PhoneAmbient`, not a type
- `src/shared/atomic-write.ts` - sole write-then-rename and temp-suffix owner; residue-tested
- `src/shared/durable-store.ts` - atomic snapshots and per-file quarantine boundaries
- `src/shared/session-store.ts` - authoritative gateway sessions keyed by `spawn.id`

- `src/shared/board-rank.ts` - sibling ordering and asserted fractional ranks
- `src/shared/agent-screen.ts` / `pane-trim.ts` - pure tmux-pane reads with Kotlin twins and shared fixtures
  - **A rule is a RUN, not a LINE, and `afterRuleRun` owns it:** `-J` welds rows. Windows panes weld composer rules to adjacent rows. Readers use `footerRegion`.
  - **Two rule notions are distinct:** `TOOLBAR_RUN_RE` is U+2500 only; `ANY_RULE_RUN_RE` spans U+2500-U+259F.
  - **`limitNotice` searches in two passes:** whole-line matches precede welded-rule matches.
  - **The composer glyph has two members:** Linux uses U+276F; Windows uses U+003E. Whitespace is explicit because JS and JVM `\s` differ for U+00A0.
  - **The last-two-lines fallback is uniform:** readers scope it to the final region.
- `src/shared/schemasConsoleOp.ts` - ConsoleOp schema, `DELIVERY_OP_KINDS`, and `VALUE_OP_KINDS`

- `tests/fixtures/wire/ts/` / `wire/kotlin/` - minted wire fixtures, each runtime's real composers under the set; `scripts/gen-wire-fixtures.ts` and `WireFixtureGenerator.kt` write them, `check:fixtures` and `kotlin-gate.sh` diff them
- `src/testing/` - the federation harness, `fixtureWorld.ts`, real Router and gateway graph in-process, friend Domains linked through the real handshake, fake host and session sockets with the fake Codex daemon, the TS phone driver, the console socket; `docs/testing.md`
- `src/testing/fakeAmbient.ts` - the harness ambient: a clock offset on the harness `now`, entropy seeded per instance so two peers never collide, and timers on either drive. "real" (the default) rides the process timers so every scenario makes progress unchanged; "manual" holds them until `advance(ms)` reaches each deadline, yielding to the event loop between firings
- `scripts/check-boot-runtime.ts` - the real entry points under Bun, one console op through a fake host
- `skills/crosstalk/SKILL.md` - agent-facing tool reference

## Architecture

**`main-mcp.ts`** MCP plugin, user process.
**`main-gateway.ts`** Docker gateway and central router.
**`main-host-daemon.ts`** host `host` WS slot, devcontainer wake, session spawn, terminal view.
**`main-federation.ts`** self-hosted federation relay.
**`main-vault-askpass.ts`** askpass helper on the host; asks the phone through the gateway, falls back to the tty.

| 20000 | Gateway HTTP and WS, loopback only |
| 20001 | Federation Router TLS |

## Development

### Commands

- `bun run lint` - Biome and `tsc`.
- `bun run test [path]` - Vitest.
- `bun run gen:fixtures` - regenerate the TS wire fixtures.
- `bun run check:fixtures` - regenerate the TS wire fixtures and diff.
- `bun run build patch|minor|major` - release build and commit.
- `bun run build --build-only` - bundle without versioning.
- `bun scripts/codegen-kotlin.ts` - regenerate Kotlin protocol types. A `src/shared/schemas*.ts`
  change must carry the regenerated `Protocol.kt` in the SAME commit. `lint` and `test` both pass
  with it stale, so run `./scripts/kotlin-gate.sh`, which diffs it. CI is the only other check.
- `bun scripts/check-module-residue.ts` - verify `node_modules` against `bun.lock`.
- `bun scripts/import-stts-voices.ts` - regenerate the committed TTS catalog.
- `bun scripts/sync-leaf.ts <path>` or `--all` - synchronize a leaf.

### Push straight to `main`

Commit and push to `main`. Do not open a branch or a PR for ordinary work, and do not leave one
open: an unmerged PR is work the owner will forget.

Nothing BLOCKS a push, so run the local gates first. CI does run: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` repeats
lint, tests, `check:boot`, `check:pinning` and the drift checks on every push to `main`, and
`main-push.yml` builds Android. They report after the fact, so a red run is found only by looking.
Check `gh run list` after a push.

A gate that CI does not run is a gate nobody runs. `check:boot` sat outside the workflow for months
while `AGENTS.md` called it the shipping-composition gate.

Run `gitFetch` and `gitPull` before every follow-up edit after a push. A non-empty
`git log main..origin/main` is a hard stop. Scripted edits must assert their match before writing.

`gitPushNewBranch` resets local `main` to `origin/main`, taking the commit with it, so the work then
lives only on the branch until the PR merges.

### Verify locally before pushing, especially Android

CI does not compile Kotlin before merge. Run:

```bash
./scripts/kotlin-gate.sh
```

Resolves the repo root and sources the SDK env itself, so it runs from any directory.

Regenerate Kotlin wire fixtures with `./gradlew :app:generateWireFixtures` from `android/`.

`testDebugUnitTest` is un-minified. Both debug and release are R8-minified, so verify reflective
Android and JavaScript bridge entry points with `assembleRelease` or on-device. The
`@JavascriptInterface` keep rule in `app/proguard-rules.pro` is load-bearing.

The sibling **evie-bot** repo must be checked inside its devcontainer:

```bash
bun run lint && bun run test
```

### Debug APK to the phone

The phone runs the CI build, signed with the stable key kept in `~/android-dev/secrets/`. `env.sh`
exports that key as the `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_*` variables the Gradle signing config reads, so a local
debug build installs straight over it. Without those exports the build signs with the default debug
key and the phone refuses the install. The version code must exceed the installed one.

```bash
source ~/android-dev/env.sh
INSTALLED=$(adb shell dumpsys package com.atelier_nyaarium.switchboard | grep -o 'versionCode=[0-9]*' | cut -d= -f2)
cd android && ANDROID_VERSION_CODE=$((INSTALLED + 1)) ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/switchboard-debug.apk
```

The phone stays on wireless adb; `adb devices` lists it. No push or CI round trip is needed.

### Emulator build

Use the `emulator` variant for visual inspection without onboarding or a real Gateway:

```bash
source ~/android-dev/env.sh
cd android && ./gradlew :app:assembleEmulator
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/emulator/switchboard-emulator.apk
adb shell pm grant com.atelier_nyaarium.switchboard.sandbox android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS
adb shell am start -n com.atelier_nyaarium.switchboard.sandbox/com.atelier_nyaarium.switchboard.MainActivity
adb exec-out screencap -p > /tmp/shot.png
```

It installs beside the real app. Emulator seeding bypasses mailbox draining, so handler-created
state must be seeded directly. Run `adb emu kill` when finished.

Start the emulator with `-no-window` from a session with no display, or it dies on the Qt platform
plugin and reads as a broken emulator rather than a missing one:

```bash
emulator -avd <name> -no-window -no-audio -no-boot-anim -gpu swiftshader_indirect &
```

`SandboxGateways.kt` answers the runbook and routine calls as a Gateway would, which is what makes a
screen that only appears on a refusal reachable at all. They are ports, not sockets.

The sandbox renders nothing until the boot is Ready, and it reaches no Router at all. Both are held
by `SandboxSeeder.kt`:

- **`Need` cannot grow without the sandbox growing with it:** `seedSandboxIdentity` writes every
  identity fact `PhoneBootstrap.assemble` asks for, and `SandboxIdentityTest` asserts the boot it
  produces is Ready. A `Need` added without it leaves the build on the onboarding screen, which no
  other gate can see.
- **`isSandbox` closes every network door, not the caller in front of it:** the guards sit in
  `SwitchboardService.start`, `ConsoleSocketDriver.connect`, and the transport's `postOwnerOp` and
  `apiReachable`, because four receivers and the activity all start the service. An owner op
  cancels its own caller rather than throwing, since the scopes that launch one do not all handle a
  failure, and the socket does not open at all, since its failure lands on OkHttp's dispatcher where
  no caller's `runCatching` reaches it. A screen waiting on a Gateway stays on its pending state
  here, which is the honest answer. `sandbox-network-residue.test.ts` reads every `newCall` and
  `newWebSocket` on the phone and refuses a file that opens one without asking, so a new door is a
  decision rather than an oversight. Its allowlist names why each exempt file is exempt.

### Dependencies

Exact pins only. After a manifest change:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules && bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun scripts/check-module-residue.ts
```

Bun leaves unsanctioned nested `node_modules` copies that can shadow the lockfile version.

### Synced leaves

| Source | Copy |
|--------|------|
| `src/shared/notice.ts` | `nyaaskills/src/shared/notice.ts` |

CI enforces the `SYNC-HASH` and the copy. Always use `sync-leaf.ts`: format, restamp, then copy.

### Code style

Biome: tabs, double quotes, semicolons, 120-character width.

**I don't trust you with comments, so always fan out a couple Workflow edits to Luna to clean your
pollution:** If `switchboard_capabilities` list **Codex**, use Sonnet to verbatim relay to Codex
Luna. Otherwise, audit with Sonnet.
1. Violators of /coding guidelines. Especially overly long comments (keep to 4 words or less, unless
   CRITICAL), narrative comments. Anything listed in `## Documentation Style`.
2. Units that test plain internal states instead of behavior. They report, you fix if real.

**Hand the change itself to an auditor too, and tell it to read /architecture:** Name the skill in
the prompt, because an auditor that is only shown a diff reviews the lines in it and reports nits. It
has to look wider than the diff: what class does this change belong to, where else does that class
live, and did the change leave a sibling instance behind. Ask for defect classes, not line notes.

**Same bug twice is a design bug:** Note which mechanism each fix lands in. The second or third time
you patch the same defect class in the same mechanism, that is a /architecture violation, not bad
luck. Land the smallest patch that keeps it green, then record the mechanism, the defect class, and
what each round patched. Inside a nyaaskills cycle that goes under a `### Bug Classes` heading in the
current phase's section of the plan file. Everywhere else it goes on the Task Board, claimed.

**A test that fails sometimes is a defect until it is proved otherwise:** Calling it a flake is a
diagnosis, and it needs the same evidence as any other. `8e0c3bf5` was dismissed as load-sensitive
three times before CI showed a plain TypeError.

**A decision the phone makes lives beside its ops class, never in the screen:** there is no
`androidTest` source set, so nothing can call into a `@Composable`, and a rule written inside one is
invisible to every gate. State lives in the screen, so rules drift there. `overwriteRevision` began
as an expression inside `RunbookEditor` and was wrong twice before it was moved out and covered.
Extract it, name it, and test it beside `standingConflict` and `pushDecision`.

**A gate that cannot see a failure is not covering it:** Before calling a path done, ask what would
have caught it. The phone compiles regexes ICU refuses and the desktop JVM accepts, and the harness
attaches its fake session on a timing that made a real wake race impossible to reproduce. Both
passed every gate. Run the path where it actually runs, or fence what the gate cannot reach.

**Do not sanitize invisible characters in display strings:** `oneLine` collapses ASCII whitespace,
which is the whole of it. No category strip, no bidi rule, no Unicode whitespace set.

**A long-lived coroutine scope on the phone carries a `CoroutineExceptionHandler`:** it outlives the
call that made it, so a throw inside has no caller to catch it, and a `SupervisorJob` only spares
the siblings. These scopes reach the Router, where a dead network throws, and the process goes down.
`coroutine-scope-residue.test.ts` reads every one, since no gate here runs the phone.

### Testing

Vitest runs under Node. The gateway, Router, and daemon run under Bun. `ws` and WebSocket behavior
therefore differ. `bun run check:pinning` is the shipping-runtime gate. `bun run check:boot` is the
shipping-composition gate: it boots the real Router and gateway under Bun and runs one console op
through a fake host. The in-process harness and the fixture corpora are in `docs/testing.md`.

### Debugging the console on-device

Debug APK logs flush to the Router's `/ingest`; release does not. Logs are not private. Never log
bearer credentials, invite nonces, or minted secrets.

```bash
docker logs switchboard-federation --since 15m 2>&1 | grep '\[console-ingest\]'
```

### Restart ritual

`./start-all.sh` is `./down.sh`'s counterpart, starting all three in order. Each component script
stays independently usable; a Gateway-only machine runs `./start-gateway.sh` alone.

```bash
./start-all.sh
```

`start-federation.sh` rebuilds the Router image on every start.
`start-host-daemon.sh` restarts the daemon. Declining a restart leaves the running build serving.
`./setup.sh --verify` checks Router reachability and Gateway registration.

The Router certificate is not rotatable without re-provisioning enrolled Gateways and phones.
Clock drift breaks signed proofs and invite expiry.

## Deploying

### The four components update on SEPARATE triggers

| Component | Updates when |
|-----------|--------------|
| MCP plugin | marketplace pull or session restart under autoUpdate |
| Gateway | manual restart |
| Host daemon | `./start-host-daemon.sh` |
| Console | app update |

New wire fields OPTIONAL at the gateway and tolerated by both peers. Deploy gateway first, then push the version bump. The plugin can update before the other components.

A field that is optional only to cross that gap, and should be required once every part has updated, carries a comment above it naming the date it becomes required, about two weeks out. A field that is optional by meaning carries no date.

That order covers fields the gateway EMITS. A change to what the Router ANSWERS deploys the Router first, since a gateway reads the answer it is given.

### Plugin

1. Commit source work.
2. Run `bun run build patch|minor|major`.
3. Push.
4. Reload target containers with `reload_plugins`.

The build derives versions, bundles `dist/`, and commits the release. Do not hand-edit version fields. Bun 1.4.0 or newer required.

### The lexicon submodule

`lexicon/` supplies the client at build and test time. `postinstall` links its packages into `node_modules/@nyaa-lexicon/`; runtime uses the bundled client.

- Fresh clone: `git submodule update --init` before `bun install`.
- Pin moves require a committed submodule change before release.
- Never install inside `lexicon/`. Nested `node_modules` shadow root dependency pins and produce duplicate packages.
- A real `node_modules/@nyaa-lexicon` directory is invalid. It must link into `lexicon/`.

### Installing

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add atelier-nyaarium/claude-marketplace
claude plugin install switchboard@atelier-nyaarium
```

### Federation

The gateway-to-Router WS is admission-only. No bearer fallback.

Run `./setup.sh` first. Admin Provision starts the Router, writes `.env`, and emits a direct transport blob containing the Router URL, `/health` fingerprint, and app token. An unreadable Router state must abort provisioning. An empty read can stage a new Domain over an existing rooted one.

Gateway Setup displays the admit payload and waits on the same screen for the phone's sealed bundle. `prompt()` blocks polling, so `readKeyWhile` uses raw mode and restores cooked mode on every exit. The screen prints the SAS from the admit payload. The countdown starts when `armGateway` returns, before health and payload waits. No LAN block means paste is the only enrollment route.

Purge Gateway removes only gateway state and gateway-owned `.env` keys. Purge Federation removes this owner's Domain slice first, then performs the gateway purge and removes the Domain id and setup code. The Domain id may come from `.env` or the Router's admin-Domain mark.

**Purge Gateway does not revoke the Gateway:** Only the phone holds the signing key. Use Revoke in the app.

**`.env` is shared by the gateway and Router:** Purges must preserve the file.

**The phone's half of Purge Federation is Forget this Domain:** Revoke and Delete is app-only because it purges the Domain server-side.

`scripts/lib/routerState.ts` keeps Bun `$` templates on one line. Bun treats a backslash-newline as an argument split, not continuation.
