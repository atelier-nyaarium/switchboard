# Federation

The self-hosted Router, how a Gateway reaches it, and the trust model.

**Compatibility:** Protocol version 3, and the floor is 3. A Gateway below it is refused at registration with `version_too_old` and the Router closes the socket after the answer; a current client logs the floor and stops, an older one reconnects and is refused again, and either way the Gateway serves nothing through the Router until it is restarted on a current build. A gateway id that is not a slug is refused before it is logged.

## Self-hosted Router

`src/federation-server/` is the Router. Three surfaces share one TLS port: bearer-gated gateway WS,
signed OwnerOps for the phone, and token-exempt device approval for fresh devices.

The Router certificate is minted once. Rotation requires re-provisioning every enrolled Gateway and
phone. It is distinct from the ephemeral certificate used by the 20003 enrollment listener.

**Reach: one Router, several addresses:** Home routers may not hairpin LAN-to-public connections. The
Router advertises `{publicHost, publicPort?, lanAddresses}` through the app-token-gated `reach` op.
The phone stores this in `reach.json` and tries LAN addresses, public host, then bootstrap address.

**Gateway and phone fail over differently:** The phone fails over per operation. The Gateway fails
over per reconnect, advancing only when a socket never opened.

- Gateway registration cannot call `reach`: it has a WS bearer, not the console app token. It
  receives optional reach data in `gateway_register`.
- `FEDERATION_ROUTER_HOST` overrides the sealed bundle address for Gateway setup.
- LAN uses the Router port. Public uses `publicPort`; absent means the Router port.
- A private candidate uses `LAN_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS`.
- The typed address remains last. There is no last-successful-address field.
- `reach.json` stays beside `transport.json`; delivered transport bytes remain stable while learned
  reach data changes.
- Reach is not exposed on `/health`.
- Failover follows thrown `IOException`, not HTTP status. It re-posts the same signed op, so the
  Router answers a repeated nonce with the first answer, in flight or settled, within the skew window.
- Debug ingest uses the transport's current base after reach changes.

## Pinning the Router

The Router leaf is self-signed. Its fingerprint is its identity. `gateway/router/pinnedSocket.ts`
owns the check.

- **Pin before the WS upgrade:** The bearer must not be sent before the TLS leaf matches.
- **Resolve the real `ws` package:** Bun's bare `ws` substitution lacks peer-certificate access and
  ignores `createConnection`.
- Preserve `match`, `mismatch`, `unreadable`, and `pending` as separate verdicts.
- Chain verification stays off. The fingerprint is the identity check for this self-signed leaf.
- `assertBunFloor` requires Bun 1.4+. `check-pinning-runtime.ts` verifies runtime behavior. Node uses
  the real `ws` package.
- `moduleDir()` must use `fileURLToPath()`, not URL pathname conversion.

## Trust

The Router routes opaque sealed payloads by `dstGateway` and `relayId`. It cannot read or forge E2E
payloads. Presence rows are not sealed: the Router folds the owner projection, and a gateway keeps
only its own rows authoritative.

The owner device is the trust root. Owner-signed admissions are mirrored on the Router and every
Gateway, so revocation still applies while the Router is unreachable.

- **Crypto:** Ed25519 signing, X25519 boxes, HKDF-SHA256, and AES-256-GCM. AES-256-GCM is required
  because Bun lacks ChaCha20.
- **Never sign raw JSON:** Versioned newline-joined encodings are reproduced byte-exactly across
  Node, Bun, and Android.
- Registration requires keys, an owner-signed admission, and fresh possession proof. No bearer
  fallback.
- A Gateway without a Domain starts standalone for `/health` and `/enroll`; the Gateway federation bridge activates only
  when both transport and Domain resolve.
- Enrollment roots the first owner key through a single atomic CAS write. The owner root private key
  never leaves the phone.
- `ReplayGuard` runs after signature verification.
- Trust-on-first-enroll rejects later snapshots rooted at a different owner key.
- Phone OwnerOps are sealed and signed by the enrolled console key. The Router checks the owner-signed
  `kind:console` admission.
- `CONSOLE_BRIDGE_TOKEN` remains the shared app-token gate for the console surface.
- A cross-Domain pairing names the Domain root, never the signing device. The listening token
  names the receiver's gateway id, and a requester refuses a token naming its own id, so two Domains
  whose Gateways share an id pair only from a Gateway whose id differs from the receiver's.

## Content keys

- The owner phone derives each Domain-bound content key from the owner signing key and epoch.
- Each epoch-bound key envelope is sealed to the recipient's admitted box key and signed by an admitted console.
- The phone stores keys in the Keystore-backed `AppStateStore` `contentKeys` slot. The Gateway stores them in `DATA_DIR/federation/content-keys.json`.
- Add Device delivers current key envelopes in `ConsoleTransport.contentKeys`. Gateway bootstrap delivers them in `GatewayBootstrapBundle.contentKeys`.
- Bootstrap writes admission, transport, Domain id, and keys under `federation/staging/`, writes an `INSTALLED` marker, then copies the artifacts atomically with transport last. Recovery retries a complete marked staging directory, rolls back incomplete or corrupt staging, and keeps staging on other activation errors.
- Gateway re-enrollment validates the merged live and bundle view, requires a newer admission, merges the allowlist, and merges keys without dropping held epochs.
- First enrollment uses trust on first use for the Domain root.
- Deploy the Router before the app. Unsupported join signatures cause refusal.
- Blob bytes seal per chunk on the existing 1 MiB boundary, each frame being a nonce, the ciphertext and its tag. The blob id stays the plaintext digest, so the Router verifies the CIPHERTEXT digest it was told and only a reader holding the key can verify the plaintext. Chunk index and the final flag ride in the AAD, so a Router cannot reorder, truncate, or splice chunks. `src/shared/sealed-blob.ts` and `crypto/SealedBlob.kt` are twins over a shared fixture corpus.
- Board text binds its entry id into the AAD the same way. See `docs/task-board.md`.

## Inboxes

- Addresses: `owner:<domainId>/<ownerSignPub>`, `session:<domainId>/<gatewayId>/<sessionId>`, `gateway:<domainId>/<gatewayId>`.
- A row is `{ seq, acceptedAt, size, envelope, producerSig, body }`. The producer signs the envelope; the Router adds seq, acceptedAt, and size.
- The op ledger keys on `(owner, conversationId, opId)`. A repeat with the same hash answers the recorded result; a different hash answers `conflict`.
- **A retry is one operation:** The producer mints `opId` once per invocation, and every retry carries it. The identity hash covers the CLEAR operation.
- The Router and the current Gateway speak protocol version 3, which is also the floor. An older
  Gateway is refused at registration, so every registered Gateway takes value ops and delivery ops.
- Capacity refuses before storage: the row cap answers `refused`, the Domain quota answers `durability_failure`, a failed fsync answers `durability_uncertain`.
- Gateway frames name only themselves. The Router takes the Domain and gateway from the connection; a session origin must be in the session registry; a peer row into another Domain needs a link edge.
- `gateway_register` returns an incarnation. Every inbox frame carries it; a stale one is refused.
- The Router pushes `inbox_deliver` on append and again after each register. The gateway keeps a durable claim per delivery under `DATA_DIR/inbox-claims/`, offers once, and acks on the receiver's word. A redelivered claimed row is re-acked, never re-offered.
- An undelivered row expires after 30 days with an `expired` result row to its sender.
- A console reaches the inbox through signed OwnerOps: `deliver` with a `console_op` row, `consumer_register`, `inbox_read`, `inbox_advance`, `planes_read`, `report_read`, and `capabilities_report`. `gateway_value` forwards VALUE kinds as `value_op`. Delivery answers use `op_result`. Value answers use typed `unreachable` or `timeout` outcomes.

## Owner state

- Every owner-scoped record lives in the per-owner store under `DATA_DIR/owner/`, keyed by kind and id with a CAS version. A service answers only the Domain named in the call.
- Services register their ops and frames through `ownerServiceHooks.ts`. A frame handler receives the authenticated registration; the bridge deletes `domainId` and `gatewayId` from the payload first, so no handler can read one.
- `ownerOpRegistry.ts` catalogues every owner-op kind with its value schema, its mutation class, and where one exists its answer schema. Registration takes a catalogued kind, so a kind with no schema or no class cannot be added, and the intake parses the value before the handler sees it. `read` names the kinds the migration fence lets through on both surfaces, the owner-op intake and the gateway-frame catalog (`bridge/frameDispatch.ts`, one descriptor per frame the bridge dispatches with its class, its incarnation policy, and its handler); every other kind waits for the window, and a gateway writer the window refuses keeps the write pending and retries it. `delivery` is the one kind that appends a delivery row and carries its own nonce; `value` names the rest. The catalog is also the source the Kotlin `Protocol.Wire` constants are generated from.
- Presence: a gateway sends `presence_baseline` after registering and `presence_delta` with a sequence. A gap answers `presence_resync`. A dropped socket marks the gateway's rows unreachable until the next baseline. A rejected baseline or delta also answers `resync`, parks that gateway's reporter, and marks its rows unreachable until an upgraded baseline replaces them. Every served row names its Gateway and Domain. The owner projection folds rows, roster, coverage, spawn points, owner facts (Domain id, display name, admin Domain), and each linked Domain's labeled friend projection. A friend sees shared sessions only. Rows and spawn points are served only for Gateways `admittedGatewayIds` names, the rule registration uses, so a revoked Gateway's retained records vanish from both projections and come back if it is re-admitted. `presence.refresh` recomputes a Domain and every Domain whose projection embeds it after a roster, link, share, or rename change. It pushes the plane to the phone without a Gateway. A readable plane starts at version 1.
- A linked friend's sessions ride the owner projection as `linked`, built from the rows the Router
  holds for that friend and its share records; the phone lands it in
  `PresenceOps.applyCrossDomainPresence` and `/discover` folds it. No Gateway pushes or pulls
  presence to another.
- Shares: records per session target and friend, a generation per pair bumped by unshare and unlink. A peer row is admitted only while shared, stamped with the generation, and retired `target_revoked` when the generation moves before delivery. A gateway attests live cross-Domain jobs with `share_job_live`. The 30-day sweep keeps attested shares.
- A share is the Router's record and nothing else writes it. The phone posts `cross_domain_share`, `cross_domain_unshare` and `cross_domain_list_shares` as owner ops; a share names a session its Gateway has reported, or is refused `session`, which is retryable. The answer's `ok` says the line landed; a write applied in memory alone answers `ok: false` with its outcome, and the phone posts again.
- A Gateway learns its own sessions' shares by revision. The Router keeps one `share.mirror` revision per Gateway, moved in the same batch as any record added or removed for that Gateway's sessions, and pushes a `share_delta` frame carrying the new revision to that Gateway. The Gateway applies a delta only at its held revision plus one; anything else, and every registration, reads the whole set with `share_mirror_read`, a read frame the migration fence lets through. Until a snapshot of the current registration lands the Gateway's copy answers nothing shared, so a file that predates a withdrawal it was not connected to hear admits nothing. A Router restored from a backup answers the shares it held then, and the Gateways follow it.
- A share names a Domain; it takes effect on a Gateway once that Gateway holds a pairing with a Gateway of that Domain. Until then it is dormant.
- A peer reply back into the origin Domain targets a job key, not a registered session. It is admitted by the origin's own link edge instead of a share. A linked Domain can therefore append reply rows for jobs the gateway does not hold; the gateway drops them at delivery, and the inbox row cap bounds the flood.
- `cross_domain_unlink` and a signed `revoke_xdomain_link` both drop the Domain's link edge and its shares, so a later link starts private.
- Board: entries with a clear envelope and sealed title, body, and names; writes carry `expectedRevision` and no actor, because the receiver names the writer from the authenticated channel; the same authority and cascade rules the gateway used, plus `mayTake` for claim and release; observations land as `board_observation` rows in the affected sessions' inboxes. Attachments must be held in the reference-held store.
- Scheduled sends: one record per target; replace and cancel are versioned; a Router timer fires through the op ledger under the send's own op id and writes a `scheduled_result` row the phones fold.
- Capabilities and read anchors are tier-1 records with their own OwnerOps.
- Vault: entries with a clear envelope (id, revision, tombstone, `createdBy`, `changedAt`) and six sealed fields under `vaultAadKind(kind, id)`, so a field opens only under its own entry. A phone writes through `vault_put` and `vault_delete` with `expectedRevision`; a gateway creates through the `vault_create` frame and never updates; both read through `vault_list` and `vault_read`, which answer a delta after `sinceRevision` with tombstones riding along, and a full list (`since` 0) when the cursor predates a swept tombstone. Tombstones keep the envelope with every field wiped and are swept after seven days. Every applied write pushes the `vault` plane with the new revision. The Router opens no field; `vault-router-residue.test.ts` fences the directory. The gateway's client, grants, request road, and loopback routes, and the phone's side, are in `docs/vault.md`.
- Every owner-state sweeper registers through `hooks.onSweep`. The Router's sweep tick runs them per Domain and holds every Domain the migration fence covers.
- A gateway's presented admission stays on its connection record and is re-resolved against the current revocations on every frame; a revoked signer's connections leave through the one drop path. A value op to a Gateway `admittedGatewayIds` does not name answers `unreachable`.
- Revocation is signed history, never deletion. `federation.json` keeps every admission and revocation, and the revocation is what refuses the Gateway's old bundle at registration, which trusts the admission the Gateway presents. Purge Gateway cannot tell the Router a Gateway is gone, since only the phone holds the owner key. The bridge's refusals (`not_registered`, `gateway_not_admitted`, `inbox_unavailable`, `stale_incarnation`) are declared in `wire-vocabulary.ts`.
- Blobs: the Router is the one holder. `blob_begin` declares the sealed size and ciphertext digest and answers a lease, or `complete` when the bytes are already held; `blob_chunk` lands sealed frames under that lease and the Router verifies the digest at the final one. Bytes nothing names are `staged` and swept after an hour; a row, board entry or scheduled record that names them is published in the same journal line as its reference set, and a write naming bytes the Router does not hold is refused `blob_missing`. A `hold` reference keeps relayed bytes for a bounded time before any record names them. `blob_fetch` answers a sealed range or `absent`; there is no origin to forward to. Owner ops `blob_begin`, `blob_chunk`, `blob_upload_status` and `blob_fetch` give the phone the same road, and chunk nonces derive from the key and the chunk's AAD, so a repeated chunk carries the same bytes.

**A cross-machine answer states completeness:** `discover()` returns asked, answered and unreachable
ids plus `rosterKnown`. `isRegistered` differs from `isConnected`: a refused registration leaves
the socket open, so a revoked gateway reads as alone. The console retains rows for an unreachable
gateway rather than sweeping them.

## Migration

### Preconditions

Router live. Key backfill confirmed for every member. Leases set for every member.

Leases support `active`, `offline`, `retired`, and `excluded` Gateway states.

### Gateway fence

The Gateway writes `DATA_DIR/migration-epoch`. Phones and agents see `migrating` for fenced writes.
Wait 60 seconds for in-flight operations to settle.

### Authority

Migration authority turns on when every `active` lease has `completedEpoch` equal to `N`. An
`offline` Gateway stays fenced on reconnect until it completes. `retired` and `excluded` Gateways
stay fenced on reconnect. Non-active leases do not block authority.

### Phone

The Router welcome carries `migrationEpoch`. The phone runs self-migration once per epoch, on any
accepted welcome. Read anchors re-report. Every accepted scheduled send goes back to pending, and
the drain re-posts it under its own op id; a Router that still holds it answers `accepted` with
the record it has.

### Recovery

| Crash point | Safe rerun |
|-------------|------------|
| Fence before settle | Wait 60 seconds |

Lowering the fence refuses before 60 seconds or with a malformed fence. A missing fence also refuses.
