# Runbooks

A runbook is a message the owner sends often, with blanks. The body is prose they wrote, the blanks
are `{{name}}` placeholders, and firing one fills them in and delivers the result to an agent's
session as a message from the owner.

They exist because a message worth sending twice is worth not retyping, and because a body can carry
rules as well as steps. "Never hand-edit a version" belongs in the release runbook, since the agent
reading it may not go looking for `AGENTS.md`.

## Where a runbook lives

Per gateway, on the machine that will run it. The phone holds the library and pushes a copy to a
gateway that is missing it or holds an older one, which happens automatically before a fire.

Nothing about a runbook is capped. A record is refused for what it means, never for its size.

## The grammar

`src/shared/runbook-grammar.ts` owns it, and everything that reads a body derives from `parseBody`.

- `{{name}}` is the only placeholder. A `{{` that opens no placeholder is refused, so text merely
  shaped like one is a parse decision rather than a guard beside a scan. A lone `}}` stays literal,
  since prose about JSON closes nested braces.
- A body's placeholders **are** its parameter list. `runbookRefusal` in `src/shared/schemasRunbook.ts`
  refuses either without the other, so no stored runbook carries a blank nothing can fill or a
  parameter nothing uses.
- `renderRunbook` substitutes once, then parses its own output. A value and the literals around it
  can each be innocent and still compose a placeholder only after substitution, which no check on
  the body alone can see.

A parameter is `text` or `choice`. A choice must offer at least one option, and a filled value may
not open a placeholder of its own.

## The gateway

`src/gateway/runbooks/store.ts` holds them durably beside the vault's stores. It is the only writer,
so a stored record has passed the rules, and restore keeps whatever the schema accepts rather than
discarding the owner's work.

The gateway owns the revision. A put carries `baseRevision`, the revision the caller read, and the
gateway stores at its own successor and answers with the record it wrote. Nothing on the phone
chooses a number, so nothing can choose one the gateway would not have.

A put whose base is not what the gateway holds is refused and told what is. That is what stops a
second device erasing an edit it never read. A repeat of the stored content at the stored base is a
retry of a lost answer. A base for an id the gateway has never seen is refused too, since the caller
believed something was there.

The gateway cannot tell a copy that descends from the one it holds from a divergent one, so
`overwrite` replaces regardless, still at the next revision. Only an owner tap reaches it:
`RunbookOps.sync` never sets it, and `save` defaults it off.

A revision has a ceiling, and a runbook that reaches it can no longer be written.

The phone's library holds one copy per runbook, and its revision is the home gateway's. Another
gateway mints its own, so the two drift; a copy per gateway is the shape that fixes it.

Five console ops, all owner-authenticated: `runbook_list`, `runbook_put`, `runbook_delete`,
`runbook_preview` and `runbook_fire`.

## Firing

`src/gateway/console/consoleRunbookFire.ts` renders and delivers. `textOf` is the one road from an
id and values to text, so a preview cannot answer something a fire would not send.

- A fresh target creates the session, waits for it to register, then delivers. Launch and delivery
  share no ordering, so a session that never starts listening is left running and reported rather
  than closed or delivered into blind.
- An existing session target delivers straight away, through the same route a typed message takes.
  A session between sockets has the message queued, exactly as a typed one would be.
- A fire happens once per operation, guarded by the gateway's `op-idempotency` store. Value ops are
  not deduplicated upstream, so a gateway without that store refuses to fire at all rather than
  quietly dropping the guarantee. A completion on disk replays; a fire this process started is held
  in memory and refuses a second attempt; anything else runs, so a gateway that died mid-fire can be
  retried rather than wedged. The memory is released only once the completion is durable.
- A fire may name the revision it previewed. One that has moved on is refused rather than sending
  words the owner never read.

A fired body leaves the same `sent` row a typed one does, so it is in the owner's history.

## The phone

The phone is every runbook's sole author. `RunbookManager` owns the library and its persistence, the
way `BoardManager` and `VaultManager` own theirs, and it is cleared on re-provision with them.
`RunbookOps` owns the gateway calls; `pushDecision` beside it is the sync rule.

The Runbooks tab lists the library with Fire on each row.

The fire sheet takes the values, where it lands, and shows a preview before Fire. That preview is
`runbook_preview`, rendered by the gateway rather than on the phone, so there is one implementation
of the grammar and nothing to keep two of them honest. An edit marks the shown text stale and Fire
waits, so the sheet never offers to send something it is not showing.

## The editor

`RunbookDraft` is what the editor holds: a name, a body, and settings keyed by placeholder name.

- The parameter list is derived. `RunbookGrammar.kt` is a Kotlin twin of `placeholdersOf`, pinned to
  the TypeScript by `tests/fixtures/runbook-grammar/vectors.json`. It recognises names and renders
  nothing, because a render must be the gateway's own for a preview to match what a fire sends.
- Deleting a placeholder orphans its settings rather than dropping them, so pasting it back restores
  them. `toRunbook` prunes the orphans, which is the only place they stop being remembered.
- `RunbookDraft.refusal` carries every rule `runbookRefusal` would refuse on, so Save is never
  offered for a runbook the gateway will reject.

## A refused push

Any phone may author a runbook, so a Gateway refuses anything but the next revision and answers both
a reason and the revision it holds.

`RunbookOps.save` pushes before it answers. Stored, and the library takes it and the editor closes.
Refused, and the library is untouched and the editor stays open with the reason and an Overwrite
action. Unreachable, and the copy is local, which is what a phone-owned library means with no Gateway
listening; the next preview or fire pushes it.

Overwrite records intent rather than rewriting the draft, and `save` mints the outgoing revision from
what the library currently holds. Both halves matter: a Gateway that is behind would otherwise be
handed a revision the phone's own library outranks, so the write would land there and never come
back, leaving the two disagreeing while the owner was told it was refused.

A turned-down save is a `SaveRefusal`: a reason and the revision whoever turned it down holds.
`gatewayRefusal` reads one out of a Gateway answer and `libraryRefusal` builds one when the phone's
own library declines, so the two are never confused for each other.

`refusalToShow` decides which one the owner sees: the refusal the current save earned outranks one
left standing from an earlier push, and `standingRefusal` drops the leftover once the copy in hand
has moved past what was refused. The editor and the fire sheet both read it through that filter, so
neither explains a block with a refusal that no longer causes one.

The fire sheet carries the same action. A preview that cannot be rendered because the Gateway refused
the sync shows the reason and an Overwrite beside it; one that failed for any other reason shows no
action, since there is nothing to force.
