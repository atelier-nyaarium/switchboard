# Vault

The owner's secrets. Sealed on the phone, held on the Router, handed to a session only after the
owner approves the use.

## Where the vault lives

The Router keeps one entry set per owner and opens no field. The record shape, the phone's writes,
and the delta list are in `docs/federation.md` under Owner state.

## Gateway client

`gateway/router/vaultClient.ts` is the gateway's only door.

- **It is the sole sealer and opener of vault fields:** `vault-door-residue.test.ts` fences the
  directory. Every field seals under `vaultAadKind(kind, id)`, so a field opens only under its own
  entry.
- `refresh()` reads `vault_read` after the held revision and merges the delta through the shared
  `foldVersionedList`: a full list replaces the held copy, an older full list is a late answer and
  is ignored, and a delta that rests on another revision restarts from zero. A
  `durability_uncertain` answer reads as unavailable.
- `view` opens every field but the value. `openValue` opens the value. `openTyped` opens a value the
  owner typed for one request, under that request's id.
- **The sealed `gateways` field is the allowlist:** A JSON array of gateway ids. An absent field
  admits every gateway. A field this gateway cannot open or parse admits none.
- `create` seals a title, a value, and an optional description, then writes `vault_create` at
  revision 0. A gateway never updates an entry.

## Grants

`gateway/vault/decisions.ts`, under `DATA_DIR/vault-decisions.json`.

- `once` leaves no grant. `window` covers one entry, the programs one line named, and one session
  for 30 minutes. `session` covers every shape of one entry for one session, until the session ends
  or eight hours pass. **A helper's session tap records a window:** every process on the host
  shares the helper's token, so a whole-session grant there would cover them all.
- **The shape is the program plus its first argument:** `shapeFrom` in `src/shared/selector-key.ts`
  takes the program's basename. `selectorKey` applies it to a line with sudo's askpass flag dropped,
  as `askpassBrief` drops it, so what askpass presents and what an authorization policy stores are
  one rule. A policy's `selectorKeys` hold keys, never typed examples: `canonicalPolicy` derives
  them and `policyRefusal` refuses anything that is not one. The Gateway keeps its policies in
  `policies.json`, written only by `gateway/policies/store.ts`, one enabled holder per key, at a
  revision the Gateway assigns; the four `policy_*` console operations carry the base revision they
  read, delete and enable included.
  When the first argument is a flag, the whole line is the shape, since a flag's value could hide
  the target. `displayShape` applies it to the words as written, which is what the grants tab lists
  and what a saved typed value is titled, and it holds for text no parser accepts. On the wire it
  is `displayShape`, beside `coveredShapes`, and the older `shape` rides along until 2026-09-19.
- **A window covers a set, not the shape:** `operationSet` in `gateway/vault/operationSet.ts` reads
  the line with `unbash` and names every simple command in it, reaching commands nested in shell
  constructs and in substitutions, each as its own shape by the rule above. A window grant answers
  a request only when every requested shape is in the grant, so a grant for
  `printf %s "$V" | sha256sum` never covers `printf %s "$V" | curl`. A parse failure, or a program
  count over the wire's limit, makes the line its own single shape. A window recorded without its
  set covers nothing.
- **A wrapper is peeled to the program it runs:** `sudo` and the rest of the table, their own
  options aside. A mode that runs no program is not peeled, as `sudo -e` and `command -v` are not.
  An option the table does not list stops the peel, so an unlisted one never takes its own value
  for the program. The reading is of the words, not of the machine: a program named for a wrapper
  is peeled like one, and what a program does with its arguments stays opaque. `ssh host` is one
  shape whatever runs on the far side, and `docker exec ctr curl x` and `docker exec ctr rm -rf /`
  are both `docker exec`.
- The store opens through `openDurable`, so a poisoned file starts fresh. A revocation or a
  session-end drop is written with `saveChecked` and reported once the snapshot is installed.
  Grants and expiry sweeps are best effort.
- `vault_grants` lists the live grants. `vault_revoke` drops a grant or a helper token by id; a
  revoked token takes its grants and open requests with it.

## Request road

`gateway/vault/requests.ts`.

- A request carries an id, the operation text, its `displayShape`, the `coveredShapes` it names, the
  session target, and a deadline nine minutes out. It names an entry, or it is `typed` and asks the
  owner for a value.
- **It reaches the phone as a `plugin_action` row:** `pluginId` `vault`, `actionType` `request`,
  delivered through `deliverToOwner` into the session's conversation thread, or the console's own
  conversation for the helper. The row is volatile: a restart drops it, because the waiting answer
  lived in the process that died.
- The `vault_answer` value op carries the decision and, for a typed request, the value sealed to the
  request id. A typed answer settles as `once` whatever tier was named. Deny and the deadline refuse
  alike. A deny may carry a `note`, the owner's steering, which rides the refused answer to the
  session's tool result and to the helper's stderr. An unknown or settled request answers
  `request expired`.
- An approval on an entry request also records the grant. The answer waits for its collector until
  the deadline, and the first collector takes it.
- A session's end refuses its open requests and drops its grants.
- **Every settlement sends a `retract` row:** an answer, a denial, the deadline, a withdraw, or a
  session's end. The phone drops the request and its notification on it, so a second console never
  keeps a request another already answered. An unknown id is nothing to drop.

## Loopback routes

`gateway/vault/vaultRoutes.ts`, mounted on the gateway's loopback HTTP beside the agent routes.

- **Each route resolves one principal:** A bound session by its session token, or the helper by
  `x-vault-helper-token`. A route names the kinds it serves. An unknown token answers 404, none
  answers 401, as the agent routes do.
- `/vault/search` (session): public title, public description, and whether the entry holds a value,
  for the entries this gateway may use.
- `/vault/use` (session): an entry id and the operation. A covering grant answers at once. Otherwise
  a request opens and the route waits up to `waitMs`, capped at `VAULT_ROUTE_WAIT_CAP_MS`. A wait
  that runs out answers `pending` with the request id and deadline. A second use of the same entry
  and operation while one is open joins that request rather than asking the owner twice; both
  waiters take the value the one approval covers, while a typed value still goes to one collector.
- **A caller holds at most `MAX_OPEN_PER_TARGET` open requests:** past that the route refuses with
  429, so a loop cannot bury the phone in notifications.
- **A caller that leaves takes no answer:** every wait also ends when the request's signal aborts,
  and the answer stays for the next collector.
- `/vault/collect` (session or helper): waits on a pending request the caller opened.
- `/vault/withdraw` (session or helper): closes a pending request the caller opened. A late answer
  from the phone then reads as expired and records no grant.
- `/vault/capture` (session): creates an entry from a value a session captured, trimming one
  trailing newline, and notifies the owner.
- `/vault/askpass` (helper, or a session presented beside it): an askpass command line and an
  optional `asker`. A lone entry whose public title equals the display shape goes through the grant
  road, so the title is matched on the shape while the grant covers the set. Anything else opens a
  typed request. A verified session token beside the helper token makes the session the asker, so
  the request lands in its thread and its grants apply.
- `/vault/helper-token`: gated by the host token. Mints a helper token, hashed at rest in
  `DATA_DIR/vault-helper.json`.
- The answer is `VaultValueAnswer`: `approved` with the decision and the value, `refused` with a
  reason, or `pending`.
- **The value leaves the gateway only in an approved answer.**

## Askpass helper

`src/main-vault-askpass.ts`, bundled to `dist/main-vault-askpass.js` beside the MCP entry. sudo, ssh,
and git run it with the prompt as its one argument and read the value from stdout. The decision is
`vault-askpass/askpass.ts`, over a gateway port, a tty port, and a clock.

- The brief is the caller's `/proc/<ppid>/cmdline`, joined on spaces, with `/proc/<ppid>/exe` in
  place of its first word, so a renamed binary shows where it lives. sudo's `-A` ahead of the
  command is dropped, so `sudo -A apt install foo` briefs as `/usr/bin/sudo apt install foo` and
  shapes as `sudo apt`. Without `/proc`, the prompt is the brief. The brief names the operation. It
  does not authenticate the caller: a process may claim any command line, and any `asker`, so the
  retry line is guidance, never authorization.
- **A session's own sudo asks as that session:** sudo hands the helper the caller's environment, so
  the helper sends `SWITCHBOARD_SESSION_TOKEN` beside its own token when it has one, and the gateway
  names the verified session as the requester. A terminal without one is the helper. The helper
  also sends `asker`, its parent's pid and start ticks from `/proc/<ppid>/stat`, which names one run
  of sudo, ssh, or git; a second ask under the same asker only follows a rejected value, and the
  phone says so.
- **Only a secret prompt reaches the phone:** one naming a password, passphrase, secret, token, or
  PIN, or an empty one. ssh's host-key confirmation and git's username prompt are served at the tty
  alone, so a grant never answers a yes/no.
- **The opening `/vault/askpass` call asks for no wait,** so the request id is known before anyone
  can win; every later `/vault/collect` holds. A collect that ends without an answer is followed
  by another until the request's deadline.
- **A human at the tty races the phone and the first value wins:** the helper opens `/dev/tty`
  when it can, prints the prompt there, and reads one line with echo off through an `sh` child;
  collects hold 25 seconds. When the tty wins, the phone's request is withdrawn, bounded to three
  seconds. When the phone wins, the read is abandoned, half-typed input is drained, and echo
  restored. An empty line asks again; a closed tty leaves the phone road running and says so.
  Ctrl-C ends both roads and withdraws.
- **With no tty the helper holds for the phone:** collects hold `VAULT_ROUTE_WAIT_CAP_MS`. This is
  the road for an agent's own commands and for ssh with no tty.
- A gateway that cannot be reached, a token it does not know, or an owner who declined all leave
  the tty as the only road. With no tty either, the helper exits 1. It prints nothing but the value
  to stdout; notes go to stderr. Loopback calls go through `node:http`, so a proxy variable cannot
  divert them.
- A withdrawn request is retracted from the phone; an answer that crosses it reads as expired. Any
  local process holding the token can withdraw a helper request; that denies one prompt and diverts
  nothing, since an answer is sealed to its request id.
- The token file is `VAULT_ASKPASS_TOKEN_FILE`, which the wrapper sets, or
  `~/.config/switchboard/vault-askpass.token`; the gateway is `BRIDGE_ROUTER_URL`, default
  `http://127.0.0.1:20000`. The helper needs a token but no session.
- `scripts/install-vault-askpass.ts` mints the token with the host token from `.env` (an unenrolled
  gateway refuses), copies the bundle under `~/.local/share/switchboard/`, writes the token 0600
  under `~/.config/switchboard/`, writes the `~/.local/bin/vault-askpass` wrapper with the bun that
  ran the installer, the token path, and the gateway baked in, and prints the `SUDO_ASKPASS`,
  `SSH_ASKPASS`, and `GIT_ASKPASS` exports. `--keep-token` lands a new bundle and wrapper under the
  token already there. sudo asks the helper only under `-A`, so plain sudo is unchanged.
  `SSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE=force` is optional: without it ssh asks the helper only when it has no tty.
  `vault_revoke` on the phone drops the token by id.

## MCP tools

`src/mcp/vault/vaultTools.ts`, registered when the console reports the `vault` capability and the
session holds a binding token. `vaultRun.ts` is the child run.

- `vault_search` lists the public view of the entries this gateway may use.
- `vault_run` with an `entryId` posts `/vault/use` with the command as the operation, then runs
  `sh -c command` in its own process group with the value in `$VAULT_VALUE` (or `envName`), on stdin followed by a
  newline, or in a 0600 file named by `$VAULT_FILE`, on `/dev/shm` when it takes one and the temp
  directory otherwise, unlinked on exit. Switchboard's own secrets are scrubbed from the child's
  environment. Output is held raw up to 1 MiB, scrubbed of the value's bytes into `[vault]`, then
  capped at 65536 characters per stream, so a value never straddles a cut. A value short enough to
  sit inside `[vault]` would survive the scrub, so that stream is withheld whole. The cut and the
  cap are separate facts: a capture whose stdout was cut stores nothing, since a piece of a secret
  is not the secret, while a noisy stderr costs it nothing.
- **The wait is capped at `VAULT_ROUTE_WAIT_CAP_MS` per call:** an unanswered request answers
  `pending` and a command still running answers `running`, both with a `jobId`. `vault_collect`
  continues either; `vault_withdraw` withdraws the request or stops the command, and says so when
  the gateway could not confirm. A job keeps one id from `pending` through `running`. Two collects
  on one job share an answer rather than starting the command twice. Long polls are posted once,
  never retried; a repeated run joins the request still open. The process holds the child's output
  until collected. Shutdown stops every child before it waits on anything, and the entry point
  bounds the whole of it to three seconds.
- `capture` stores the command's raw stdout as a new entry through `/vault/capture` and answers
  its id; stdout is never returned. With no `entryId` the command runs at once with nothing
  injected.
- A refusal from the route, the owner, or the request's own deadline all answer `refused` with the
  reason. A wait that runs out is `pending` or `running`, never a refusal.
- **No tool answers a value.** Every shape is still readable by another process of the same uid,
  through `/proc/<pid>/environ` or the file itself. That boundary is the plan's, not this code's.

## Phone

`android/.../vault/` and `VaultOps.kt`. The `vault` plugin gates the tab and reports the capability.

- **`VaultSealing` is the phone's only door:** a `ContentSealing` under `vaultAadKind`, the twin of
  the gateway client. A typed value seals under the request id.
- `VaultManager` holds the Router's entries under one store key and folds every list through
  `foldVersionedList`, the rule the gateway client and the board share: a full list replaces, a
  delta merges in held order, an entry never moves backward, a delta from a Router behind the held
  revision restarts from zero, and a full list behind it is a late answer. A write's own entry lands
  at once unless a newer one is held; the held revision advances only when nothing was skipped. A
  wipe bumps a generation, so work begun before it lands nothing after.
- **A save keeps every field this phone cannot open:** `sealDraft` is the rule, tested on its own.
  The gateway chips never widen a scope by emptying it; only Every gateway clears it.
- `VaultRouterWriter` posts `vault_list`, `vault_put`, and `vault_delete` as signed owner ops.
- **A revision plane is acknowledged once its list has landed:** the Router pushes the `vault`
  plane on every applied write and reports it in `planes_read`. The phone answers a bump with a list
  after its held revision and acknowledges the version only when the held revision reaches it, so
  an unacknowledged bump is offered again, and fetched at most once a minute. A bump the socket
  pushed is not offered again, so the refresh retries twice on its own.
- A request reaches `VaultPlugin` as the `vault:request` action and is held with the conversation
  it landed in; that conversation's gateway segment answers it. A duplicate dispatch and a request
  past its deadline are dropped. A restart drops expired ones. The `vault:retract` action drops one
  by id.
- **One notification per pending request:** swipe denies; tap opens the sheet, where every answer
  lives. The sheet answers with `vault_answer` through the gateway value op. Its content scrolls and
  the footer does not, so no length of operation or covered set can push the answers off the dialog.
  The footer is Deny as text and a split button: `Approve` answers once, and the arrow holds 30 min
  and This session; for a typed value, `Send`, with Send and save behind the arrow, which stores the
  value under the shape as its title. Deny opens a `Steer` field whose note rides the refusal.
- **A helper is offered no whole-session answer:** the gateway records one as a window anyway, since
  every process on the host shares the helper's token, so the sheet drops the option and says why.
  `fromHelper` is the phone's test and `isHelperTarget` the gateway's, and they are the same rule.
- **The sheet names what a window would cover:** `windowCovers` in `VaultRequestText.kt` prints the
  request's `coveredShapes` under the operation, in full, since the content scrolls. It says nothing
  when the line already names the one shape, when the request is typed, since a typed value is
  answered once and records no grant, and when the row carries no set, since a gateway that sends
  none covers one this phone cannot name. `grantCovers` does the same for the grants tab, and a
  grant recorded without a set names nothing, because the gateway refuses it.
- Vault approvals, under Settings and Security: Off, Every approval, 30-minute unlock.
  `ApprovalGate` is the one gate: it runs before an entry approval, a reveal, and a save that
  changes a stored value; a typed value never prompts. Tightening the policy is free, loosening it
  asks the owner, and any change ends the window.
- Grants are read per admitted gateway through `vault_grants` when the tab opens and after an
  approval. The session card shows YOLO for a whole-session grant and vault for a window. The tab
  lists them with Revoke.
