// The host spawn points a machine offers, and what each one launches.
//
// A host spawn point is a named SHELL on the host machine. Today there is one, `host`, which is
// bash. It produces an ordinary tmux session on the host, and everything downstream - peek,
// tmux_send, forget, SessionStore, the address grammar - reads that session the same way.
//
// This module exists because the rule "which spawn segment means the host machine" was a bare
// `project === "host"` literal in FOUR files that all had to agree: hostResolve.resolveWatchTarget,
// consoleTargets.tmuxTarget, hostDaemon's wake dispatcher, and wakeService's reservation check. A
// fifth site read the same literal as a VALUE (tmuxCore.selfSessionTarget hardcoded `name: "host"`
// while deriving its sibling field from PROJECT_NAME). Here it is one table, so a second host spawn
// point is one entry rather than an edit in every file that asks the question.
//
// Pure by construction: no node imports, so the gateway and the host MCP can both read it under the
// same rule that keeps `host-op.ts` dependency-free. DETECTION is deliberately absent - only the
// machine running the daemon can probe itself - and so is path translation, which needs `wslpath`.
//
// `windows` is PowerShell over WSL interop, and its daemon-side half lives in `windowsSpawn.ts`.

/** PowerShell over WSL interop. Its tmux session still runs in WSL; only the interpreter crosses.
 *
 * Every decision here is measured on a WSL box rather than reasoned:
 *
 * - `WSLENV`, APPENDED not assigned. An exported variable does not reach a Win32 child on its own;
 *   WSL passes only what WSLENV names. Both identity variables are listed with `/w` (cross the
 *   boundary, no path translation). Verified: the probe pane printed its own PROJECT_NAME back.
 *   Assigning would discard whatever else the environment was already propagating.
 * - `-EncodedCommand`, base64 of UTF-16LE. The alternative is hand-nested quoting through four
 *   parsers (tmux, `bash -c '...'`, powershell.exe argv, PowerShell), and base64 has no shell
 *   metacharacter, so the whole class is inexpressible rather than merely handled.
 * - `-NoExit` is the twin of `exec bash`: verified to leave a live prompt, which is what keeps the
 *   pane peekable after the agent exits.
 * - `claude.exe` by full name. Bare `claude` and `claude.cmd` do NOT resolve from Windows PowerShell.
 * - `Set-Location` ALWAYS, never inheriting. The pane inherits WSL's cwd, which puts PowerShell on a
 *   `\\wsl.localhost\...` UNC provider path. Windows PowerShell cannot give a legacy console app a
 *   UNC cwd, so a subprocess can silently land in C:\Windows and cmd.exe refuses UNC outright. It
 *   works in a probe and dies confusingly later, so the daemon resolves a real drive path and this
 *   always sets it. A context reaching here with no workdir is a daemon bug, not a default to guess.
